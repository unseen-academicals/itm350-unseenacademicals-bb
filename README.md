# This is the Git hub repo for the ITM350 team that meets on Tuesday Evening

## Git Hygiene

Maintaining clean Git practices ensures smooth collaboration and efficient version control. Here are some key guidelines for our repository:

* Branching: Always create a new branch for each feature or fix, and avoid committing directly to main.

* Commit Messages: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the changes made.

  * Example: fix: corrected login validation error

  * Use present tense and concise wording.

* Pull Requests: Submit pull requests with a clear description and request peer review before merging.

* Regular Pulls: Regularly pull updates from the main branch to keep your local branch in sync.

* Rebasing: Use git rebase instead of git merge to keep commit history clean when integrating changes.

* Avoid Large Commits: Keep changes focused and avoid bundling unrelated changes in a single commit.

* Code Reviews: Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback.

* Conflict Resolution: Resolve merge conflicts carefully and communicate any issues with the team.

Following these guidelines will help us maintain an organized and efficient development process.
